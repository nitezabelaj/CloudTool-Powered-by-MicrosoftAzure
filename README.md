# CloudTool – Powered by Microsoft Azure

## Project Description
**CloudTool – Powered by Microsoft Azure** is a demonstrative application developed in **C++** that simulates basic functionalities of a cloud system. The project is designed for educational and academic purposes, with a focus on organizing code using **functions** and presenting core concepts of cloud computing.

This project serves as a simple foundation for understanding the logical structure of a cloud application, including regions, services, security, and resource management.



## Program Structure
The `main()` function acts as the entry point of the application and calls the functions in a logical sequence to simulate the workflow of a cloud-based application.

The code is structured into separate functions to ensure:
- Better readability  
- Easier maintenance  
- Potential future scalability  



## Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++  
- **Concepts:** Functions, conditional statements (`if-else`), parameters, console output  
- **Environment:** Console Application  



## Academic Purpose
This project was developed to:
- Apply function-based programming in C++  
- Understand the logic behind a cloud application  
- Build a foundation for more advanced cloud computing projects  



## Possible Extensions
In the future, the project can be extended with:
- Interactive menus  
- File-based data storage  
- Advanced authentication mechanisms  
- Simulation of real Microsoft Azure services  



## Authors
This project was developed as part of an academic assignment by the **CloudTool – Powered by Microsoft Azure** team.
